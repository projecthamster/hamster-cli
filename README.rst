A basic CLI for the hamster time tracker.

*WARNING*
This is still pre-alpha software. Altough we are reaching apoint were most
things work as intended we make no promisse about your data as well as any
commitment. In particular there is no intension to migrate any databases from
this version to any future more mature release.

News (2016-04-16)
-----------------
Version 0.11.0 has been release. This is a major step forward as our previous
release was rushed and turned out to be not too usable at all. This release
provides a solid and robust way to handle user configs as well as providing a
default config setup. We further increased our test coverage and are well above
90% by now. Including some basic integration tests.
For more details, see the changelog.

Have fun tinkering, Eric.
